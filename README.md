Basket
===============================

version number: 0.0.1
author: Ian Hartman

Requirements
------------

Python 2.7
_Currently_ : PyQt + PySide (want to add commandline usablility in case these aren't installed ... aka they won't be)

Overview
--------

Put all your Fruits into one Basket!

Basket aims to make organizing my capstone project more manageable. Offering wrappers for NUKE and Maya, Basket will be able to keep the team working efficiently with smart file read, smart file write, folder & file localization, and more! ... (exciting, I know)

pip install not working, just don't even try. I think there is already an app up there called Basket anyway... Plus, I don't think that will be necessary but maybe... 

Installation / Usage
--------------------

To install use pip:

    $ pip install basket


Or clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Hartman-/basket.git
    $ python setup.py install
